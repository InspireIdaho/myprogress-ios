# MyProgress app
Hello InspireIdaho folks!  Feel free to clone, build, install this progress tracking app.  More detailed instructions will be forthcoming here.  Please review open issues in the tab above, and certainly open new issues with bugs or feature requests as discovered!

Your contribution to further development of this project is welcome!

There should be plenty of guides out there (including on GitHub help - links TBD) to walk you thru detailed steps; but the basic outline is:
* you register a personal GitHub account (if you don't have one already!)
* Fork this repo to your personal account
* clone your repo to your local Mac
* build/code/test locally
* push your local changes to your Forked repo
* then finally initiate a Pull request to this master repo.
